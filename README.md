## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to help people who face language barriers in healthcare. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to understand symptoms written in regional languages and give possible disease predictions with advice.

The chatbot is easy to use, and users can simply type their symptoms in natural language. The system will show:
- Likely diseases
- Disease descriptions
- Precautionary steps

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🌐 Supports **English**, **Hindi**, and **Telugu**
- 🤖 Uses **Random Forest** ML model for disease prediction
- 🩺 Gives **precautions** and **descriptions** for each disease
- 🧾 Handles **free-text input** with typos or mixed languages
- 🖥️ Simple GUI with Tkinter
- 📚 Based on real symptom datasets from **Kaggle**

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

| Dataset File              | Purpose                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Training.csv`            | Train ML model on symptom–disease pairs  |
| `Testing.csv`             | Evaluate model predictions               |
| `Symptom_Severity.csv`    | Severity level of each symptom           |
| `Symptom_Precaution.csv`  | Precaution steps in English, Hindi, Telugu |
| `Symptom_Description.csv` | Descriptions of diseases                 |

These datasets were translated from English to regional languages and contain over 100+ common symptoms and 40+ diseases.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### NLP Preprocessing
- Removes special characters and stop words
- Tokenizes and lemmatizes text
- Matches input with known symptoms using **fuzzy matching**
- Handles **multi-word symptoms** like "red sore around nose"

### Machine Learning
- Uses **Random Forest Classifier**
- Trained to predict top 3 diseases based on symptoms
- Provides confidence score for each prediction

### GUI Interface
- Built using **Tkinter**
- Real-time chatbot display
- Input box for symptoms
- Shows predicted disease, description, and precautions
